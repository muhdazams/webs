		<li> WAITERS</li>
		<p1>I was a waiter at several restaurants from the time I was 15 until I was 17 years old.<br> I work there by gaining a variety of new experiences that is how to communicate <br>with people how to use more polite language in taking orders and control some unexpected situations <br>such as customers who are less polite. This is because customer is always right so i cannot complaint to the customer<br> otherwise i do my best to give my best to the customer.</p1>

		<li> SECURITY</li>
		<p1>Right after I graduated from school I used to work as a security guard in a nearby housing estate.<br> There I found a variety of new experiences although not for long. There I could see a wide <br>variety of people with different opinions and different lifestyles. <br>As a housing security I need to make sure their residential area is safe and there is no theft or any untoward accident.</p1>

	<h2>SK SAUJANA UTAMA</h2>
	<p>I used to study as a student at Sk Saujana Utama when I was 7 to 12 years old.<br> I have learned many basic things while I have studied there. It's <br>also where I made friends and enjoyed my primary school when I was a kid.</p>

	<h2>SMK SAUJANA UTAMA</h2>
	<p> After finishing primary school, I was sent to SMK Saujana Utama secondary school at the<br> age of 13 to 17 years old. Here I have already started to face various challenges in learning and getting <br>unsatisfactory test scores in the exam. I also have many sweet memories when<br> I was growing up and various fun that I had while at SMK Saujana Utama.</p>

	<h2>UITM JENGKA</h2>
	<p> I was a pre -diploma student at UITM Jengka campus at the age of 18. I chose the <br>pre -diploma because I failed to get credit marks in English subjects during SPM. With this, <br>I have been given the opportunity by UITM to continue my studies and further into the field of diploma <br>after completing the pre -diploma. I also felt a new environtment while I was there.</p>

	<h2>UITM REMBAU</h2>
	<p>After finishing my pre -diploma, I chose to continue my studies in the field of Information management <br>diploma at the UITM Rembau campus. There are not many environmental differences in this. <br>This is because I continued my studies and met the same<br> friends and not many new friends I was looking for to be more vigilant.<br> I also hope to be able to proceed to the next level after completing this Diploma.</p>
